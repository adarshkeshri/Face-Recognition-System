# FaceRecognitionSystem
 
Facial recognition is an important task in computer vision, with many applications such as security, human-computer interaction, and social media. In this project, we present Facial recognition using Python, OpenCV and Haar Cascades. 

OpenCV is a popular open source library for computer vision that provides various algorithms and tools for image processing and analysis.We will use two main steps to build our OpenCV face recognition pipeline:
->Using face detection, which detects but does not recognize the presence and position of faces in an image
->Extract digitized images A 128-dimensional feature vector for each face (called "embedding")

Haar segment data is a predefined algorithm that can detect faces in images. We use Haar cascading information to detect faces in images and then extract face regions for further processing.

PyQT library was used to design and implement the Front-end GUI Application for smooth functioning and to build an easy-to-use model.

The system can be expanded to process multiple faces, recognize faces in real time, and integrate with other applications. Experimental results on a large dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of face detection using the Haar Cascade and OpenCV in Python. The system achieves high accuracy and power in face detection and recognition, making it suitable for face recognition applications.
